/**	@page Value Value

All values, with which Parser operates, are instances of classes, derived from Value.
Value knows it's type [Value::type], which is used in error messages.
Type can also be checked like this:
@verbatim
^if($variable is hash){when there is hash in variable}{when not hash}
@endverbatim

Value can store elements [Value::get_element, Value::put_element].
Simplest example - hash[VHash].
