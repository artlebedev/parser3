/**	@page Targets  Build targets

Parser is build as [/targets]:
- Apache 1.3 module [apache13/];
- CGI script [cgi/];
- ISAPI extension [isapi/].

Each target implements pure virtual static SAPI class - an interface of Parser with web-server.

At the very beginning an instance of Request object is created, 
which is passed an Request::Info object with request parameters.
After that Request::core method is called, which does all request processing.
