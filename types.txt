        	$var followed by whitespace -- get variable value
        	${var}followed by anything -- get variable value

        var can be of these types:
            TYPE          CONTAINS
            unknown     - empty string
            string      - string
            hash        - associates keys & values
         	object      - associates keys & values, has pseudo fields: CLASS & BASE 
         	class       - has methods & pseudo fields: NAME, CLASS & BASE 
         	method_ref  - self+method, we can call it  with params
         	junction    - context+code, we can insert it's value, it would be autocalculated

        	hash        - associates keys & values

        		$hash_variable.key < associated value

       		object      - associates keys & values, has pseudo fields: CLASS & BASE 

       			like hash, plus pseudo fields:
       			CLASS < object's class
       			BASE < object's base class

       		class       - has methods & pseudo fields: NAME, CLASS & BASE 

       			like hash,  plus pseudo fields:
       			NAME < class name
       			CLASS < same as class itself
       			BASE < class' base class

       		method_ref  - self+method, we can call it  with params

       			pass

       		junction    - context+code, we can insert it's value, it would be autocalculated

       			when getted, it's code got autocalculated in remembered context,
       			string result got inserted into get's context, 
       			possible object result got inserted into remembered context
