1.What is the process to compile Parser3?

  Just start ./buildall-with-xml script and you would get $HOME/parser3install/bin/parser3 binary.
  In case you do not need XML support, use ./buildall-without-xml


  NOTE:
  On some platforms there is special version of libgc patched to support some
  local piece of subtlety.
  Official libgc does not work there, use special version instead.
  (OpenBSD reported to be one of those)
  If you need that special version, please change buildall script accordingly.

  NOTE:
  On some systems there are no "make" and you should run 'gmake', change buildall script accordingly then.

2.What is the process to install Parser3?

  Just copy files from $HOME/parser3install directory into your cgi-bin directory.

  Files layout:
    $prefix/bin/
      parser3             -- CGI and command line Parser3 interpreter
      auto.p.dist         -- configuration file sample, 
                             copy it to auto.p and adjust to your needs
    $prefix/etc/
      parser3.charsets/   -- charset definition files
        koi8-r.cfg        -- cyrillic charset [KOI8-R encoding]
        windows-1250.cfg  -- central europian charset [windows-1250 encoding]
        windows-1251.cfg  -- cyrillic charset [windows-1251 encoding]
        windows-1257.cfg  -- baltic charset [windows-1257 encoding]

3.I have heard about $mail:receive experimental support, how do I use it?
  You need to bulid these additional libraries
      glib >= 1.2.10
      gmime >= 1.0.1 [http://spruce.sourceforge.net/gmime/sources/v1.0/gmime-1.0.8.tar.gz]
    on your system, and specify path to them to Parser3 configure script.

    glib:

    cd $HOME/parser3project/src
    #on freebsd5 this is reported to work: ftp://ftp.gtk.org/pub/gtk/v1.1/glib-1.1.16.tar.gz
    wget --passive-ftp ftp://ftp.gtk.org/pub/gtk/v1.2/glib-1.2.10.tar.gz
    gunzip -c glib-1.2.10.tar.gz | tar vxf -
    cd glib-1.2.10
    ./configure --prefix=$HOME/parser3project/gnome --silent
    make install

    gmime:

    cd gmime-x.x.x
    ./configure --prefix=$HOME/parser3project/gnome
    make install

    Then you need to change buildall script to add this to parser3 configure line:
        --with-static-mailreceive=$HOME/parser3project/gnome
    And start that changed ./buildall.

    NOTE:
    In case your glib as installed into some other prefix,
    specify it's configuration file with
        --with-glib-config=/path/to/your/glib-config
    NOTE:
    In case you are using SHARED mime library, you may want to link in direct path to it,
    use this key to specify which linker key to use do do that:
        --with-pathlink=LKEY    put dynamic libraries paths to binary
                                using linker key (-R, -rpath-link)

4.Security issues
  You can disable any exec operations by setting
  --disable-execs
  option to configure.
  file::exec, file::cgi and mail:send (unix version) methods would be disabled.

  You can enable reading and executing files, not belonging to group+user 
  other then effective by setting
  --disable-safe-mode
  option to configure.
  
  You can disable user-configured sendmail commands by forcing it, setting
  "--with=sendmail=COMMAND"
  option to configure, for example:
  "--with-sendmail=/usr/sbin/sendmail -i -t -f postmaster"

  In case you are experiencing problem with gcc runtime exception handling
  (most notable when reporting sql-related problems),
  try to configure with
  --with-sjlj-exceptions
  option.
  (HPUX is reported to be have such problems)

  By default libstdc++ is linked statically, you can re-enable dynamic libstdc++ linkage by specifying
  --with-dynamic-stdcpp
  option to configure.  


  Some root config options can be specified at configure time, and would override autodetects.

  List of enabled charsets:
  --with-charsets=CHARSET[,CHARSET,...]  Enables charsets in root config (windows-1251,
                          windows-1250 windows-1257 koi8-r; Default is windows-1251)
  SQL clients:
  --with-mysql-client=mysqlclientlib?params
  --with-pgsql-client=pgsqlclientlib?params
  --with-oracle-client=oracleclientlib?params
  
5.
  If you need to build apache 1.3 parser module, get source distribution of apache 1.3,
  run configure there, then run parser configure with one more option:
  --with-apache13=Apache13 source distribution directory
  after 'make' go to that directory and run

  ./p3runConfigure <any additional options to apache configure to pass>
  
  example:
  ./p3runConfigure --prefix=$HOME/apache13install --enable-module=rewrite

  WARNING: if you want to use apache configure option --enable-shared=max, do this:
  ./p3runConfigure --enable-shared=max --disable-shared=mod_parser3.c
